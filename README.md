# pinentry-client

This repository is a simple client API for [pinentry](https://www.gnupg.org/related_software/pinentry/index.html) written in Go.

It nescessarily includes a package for working with the [Assuan protocol](https://www.gnupg.org/documentation/manuals/assuan/Assuan.html)

While this client is usable, it was never designed for production use.  It would need some work to make a friendlier API.

There is a companion article on [my blog](https://www.velvetcache.org/2023/03/26/a-peek-inside-pinentry)
